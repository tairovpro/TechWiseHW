Create a Sign up

Capture and in a separate console.log log each textField's label and value, separated by a colon and space, e.g.:

 - Full Name: Mary Potter
 - Username: HarryPoppins


 - For the checkboxes, console.log the two statements that are true from the following four:

    - "The user has checked the legal checkbox"
    - "The user has checked the terms checkbox"
    - "The user has not checked the legal checkbox"
    - "The user has not checked the terms checkbox"


 - If the following are true, console.log "The user is eligible"

    - the passwords are both the same ( use the === strict comparison operator)
    - the user is 13 or older(COPPA)
    - the user has checked both checkboxes
    - none of the other fields are blank
    - if any of the above are not true, log that "The user is ineligible"

Stretch Goal:

 - Compare the user's age and birthdate. If their age is accurately inaccurately assessed, console.log "the user is not likely to be good at math", otherwise log that ""the user can figure out the user's age"

    - Look into the [Date Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
